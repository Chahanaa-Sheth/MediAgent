# MediAgent

**Multi-Agent Medical AI Assistant powered by LangGraph, RAG, FastAPI, React, PubMed, Pinecone, and ChromaDB**

MediAgent is a production-style AI healthcare assistant that combines multiple specialized agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), medical research retrieval, and reasoning workflows to provide evidence-based medical guidance.

## Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture

MediAgent uses specialized AI agents orchestrated through LangGraph:

* Research Agent

  * Retrieves evidence from PubMed and knowledge bases
  * Summarizes medical literature

* Specialist Agent

  * Suggests appropriate medical specialists
  * Recommends care pathways

* Drug Agent

  * Reviews medications
  * Detects potential interactions

* Emergency Agent

  * Detects red-flag symptoms
  * Escalates urgent situations

---

## AI Capabilities

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Supports retrieval from:

* PubMed
* Uploaded PDF documents
* ChromaDB
* Pinecone Vector Database

### Medical Reasoning

Workflow:

1. Symptom Extraction
2. Severity Analysis
3. Medical Research Retrieval
4. Specialist Recommendation
5. Response Generation

### Source Transparency

Responses can include:

* Research citations
* Retrieved medical documents
* Supporting evidence
* Confidence indicators
